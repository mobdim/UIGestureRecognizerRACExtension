UIGestureRecognizer+ReactiveCocoa.h
===================================

![](http://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/UIGestureRecognizer+ReactiveCocoa.svg?style=flat)

Handle gesture events as ReactiveCocoa signals!

```objc
UILongPressGestureRecognizer *recognizer = [UILongPressGestureRecognizer rac_recognizer];
recognizer.minimumPressDuration = 0.2;
[self.view addGestureRecognizer:recognizer];

[[recognizer rac_signal] subscribeNext:^(UILongPressGestureRecognizer *sender){
  // Do something with a signal.
}];
```

You can leverage ReactiveCocoa's powerful stream manipulation.

```objc
UIPanGestureRecognizer *panRecognizer = [UIPanGestureRecognizer rac_recognizer];
[[[panRecognizer rac_signal]
  filter:^BOOL(UIPanGestureRecognizer *pannizer) {
    return pannizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded;
  }]
  subscribeNext:^(UIPanGestureRecognizer *recognizer) {
    NSLog(@"Panning is end!");
  }];
```

This is just an novice example. 
Mapping / filtering / combining signals will enable you to handle complex gesture state management easier.

To avoid circular reference
---

Practically, to avoid circular reference, you should weakify `self` to do something with `self` in a block. It is recommended to use `libextobjc` to handle it easier. (https://github.com/jspahrsummers/libextobjc)

```objc
@weakify(self);
[[recognizer rac_signal] subscribeNext:^(UILongPressGestureRecognizer *sender){
  @strongify(self);
  
  // Do something with a signal and self.
}];
```
